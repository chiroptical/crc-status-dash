#### Description

Using Slurm data from your compute cluster, the percent utilization over time
is plotted. Plot updates every 5 minutes with new data being written every 15
minutes.

This is not meant as an administrative tool, but as an aesthetically pleasing
plot for users to quickly gauge the activity on the various clusters at our
center.

#### Software Resources

- [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) for plotting and updates on the fly
- [mLab](https://mlab.com/welcome/) and
  [PyMongo](http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/tutorial.html) for hosting
  and writing/reading to/from MongoDB
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) for hosting the app

#### Data Collection

Two examples of data collection scripts are given. One for a CPU cluster and
another for GPU cluster.
